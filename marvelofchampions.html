        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>
            Players take on the role of a Summoner, tasked by the Collector to build a team of Marvel heroes and villains and pit
            them against each other in combat. Gameplay is similar to Injustice: Gods Among Us and Mortal Kombat X, where the game's
            fighting arena is rendered in 3D with a 2D blueprint for the superheroes' movements. and actions. New players start with
            access to two 1-star characters and can work their way up to additional characters at higher star levels, ranging from 2
            to 6. Each of the 222 playable Marvel Comics characters is upgradable and features their own classes, moves, traits,
            abilities, and special moves, though many share animations.
            
            The game features an energy system that limits the number of mission-based battles players can compete in. Energy
            recharges automatically at a set rate over time or players can manually recharge their energy. The energy cap increases
            as players level up. Game items (such as crystals) that affect gameplay are found at the end of missions. In addition to
            missions, users can battle opponents in the game's "Versus" mode, pitting their champions against another player's in
            one-on-one or three-on-three matches in limited-time arenas. However, the opponents are controlled by AI, so it's not a
            real-time, real-player battle. Marvel Contest of Champions requires a constant internet connection for single player and
            multiplayer modes.

            The controls are designed for touch, rather than adapting virtual buttons or joysticks. The game includes light, medium,
            and heavy attack options, as well as block and dodge. The character can crawl backwards or dash forwards, and each hero
            has three special attacks of their own (unlocked with ranks and stars), as well as unique abilities and an unlockable
            personal ability (if a duplicate of the champion is collected). Synergy bonuses reward the player for matching
            characters that have a unique relationship. For example, putting Doctor Doom on the same team with Mr. Fantastic rewards
            each team member with 6% more attack. As characters take and deal damage, a power meter fills up indicating the
            potential for unique moves. As the player levels up their characters, more powerful special attacks are possible, but
            can be used less frequently due to their higher energy cost.
